# Presentation Title: Introduction to PySpark in Microsoft Fabric

# Description:
With all of the engineering features in Microsoft Fabric, which medium should you use to move and transform data? Low-code data flows and pipelines? Good old relational SQL? What about this newfangled PySpark everyone is buzzing about?

If the last option piques your curiosity and you haven't tried it, this is the session for you. I'll cover basic Python principles that will make even complicated Python easy to read. Then I will showcase how to interact with and manage your Spark environment, boosting performance while simplifying interactions with data storage in Microsoft Fabric. Finally, I'll showcase Fabric features and community content that can support your next steps in learning to implement PySpark.
